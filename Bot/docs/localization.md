# Localization

Parallel ships its translations inside the app. It does not contact a
translation service at runtime, and contributors do not need an API key.
English in `src/locales/en.json` is the source catalog; the other JSON files
are partial overlays that fall back to English for missing keys.

## Add or update a language

1. Use a lowercase BCP-47 filename such as `de.json` or `pt-br.json`.
2. Keep every key identical to an English key and preserve placeholders such
   as `{name}` exactly, including repeated placeholders.
3. Register a new pack in `src/locales/index.ts`.
4. Run `pnpm i18n:check` and test the language from **Settings → General**.

`pnpm i18n:check` is deterministic. It validates JSON structure, unknown or
empty entries, locale filename casing, placeholder parity, and the English
source hash attached to every translated value. If English copy changes, the
old translation fails the check instead of silently looking current. Missing
translations remain allowed because the runtime has an English fallback.

## Optional model-assisted draft

The repository includes a maintainer tool that sends missing or stale English
strings to an installed, authenticated Claude CLI. The CLI usually sends the
strings to its configured cloud model and may consume subscription or API
quota; “local” describes the CLI, not where inference runs.

```sh
# Safe, no-tools Claude mode
node scripts/generate-locale.mjs it "Italian"
```

Existing packs refresh only keys that are missing or whose English source has
changed, preserving reviewed translations for every other key. Use `--force`
only when intentionally re-drafting the whole pack. The tool rejects prose,
code fences, missing or invented keys, empty values, and changed placeholders
before it installs either file.

For a human-written or edited pack, review it and record which English source
each present value translates:

```sh
node scripts/generate-locale.mjs pt-br --accept
pnpm i18n:check
```

Commit `src/locales/source-hashes.json` with the catalog. The hash contains no
translation content or credential; it only lets CI detect stale copy.

Model output is a draft, not an authority. Review tone, terminology, grammar,
product names, and safety-sensitive copy before committing it. AI translation
does not run in GitHub Actions: normal CI stays deterministic, secret-free,
and safe for forks.
