//
// When a native session cannot be resumed, the harness still holds the
// canonical transcript and can rebuild the conversation. The question is not
// whether it CAN — it is whether doing so is safe. If the provider already
// accepted the prompt, the model may have run tools, written files, or sent
// messages. Replaying that turn would do it all again.
//
// So the boundary is classified from the driver's own protocol state — which
// request was in flight, whether the prompt was submitted, whether anything
// streamed — and never from error text. Provider error strings are prose:
// they get reworded between releases, they are localized, and a retry
// decision that turns on a regex over them is a duplicate side effect
// waiting for a vendor copy-edit.
//
// Lifted from #759 (aivsomkar), where the rebuild came from a context plan;
// here it is the recovery text the harness attaches to a resuming turn.
