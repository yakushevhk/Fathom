// straight to the box's REST API, and a Local VM / VPS click rides a
// transparent stdio bridge into Cua Driver.

// must never be interpreted as "the person released control": that would let
// a stale computer proxy resume acting underneath them. An unconfigured
// client remains disengaged because there is no control surface to consult.

// The state is cached briefly so a computer_batch of two dozen actions
// doesn't turn into two dozen loopback round trips.
