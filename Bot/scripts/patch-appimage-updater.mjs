// electron-updater installs an AppImage update by writing the new file under

// after the version, so a user whose AppImage is called
// Parallel-0.1.43-x86_64.AppImage ends up with a 0.1.44 file and nothing at
// the old path — every .desktop entry, symlink, dock pin and AppImageLauncher
// registration pointing at it breaks, and the app vanishes from the launcher.
//
// Upstream only overwrites in place when the running file has no version in
// its name. Force that branch unconditionally: the update lands on whatever
// path the user already launches, whatever they named it.
//
// Applied to the generated bundle by scripts/bundle-updater.mjs, and asserted
// on the committed artifact by electron/vendor-updater.node-test.mjs.

// esbuild renames the imported `path` module per build (path2, path3, …), so
// match the identifier instead of pinning one. The back-reference keeps this
// from matching an unrelated join().

// replaces the old file atomically and works over a running binary. Nothing
