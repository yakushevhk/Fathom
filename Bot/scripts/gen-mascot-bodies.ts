/**
 * Bakes the mascot body catalog into `shared/mascot-bodies.ts`.
 *
 * Run with `pnpm gen:bodies`. Everything downstream of this script — the picker, the
 * renderer, the persisted bot profile — reads the emitted module and never re-derives
 * geometry at runtime, because solving a face placement costs tens of millions of
 * distance samples and the answer never changes between runs.
 *
 * The pipeline, per body:
 *
 *   flatten            outline path data -> polylines
 *   boundsOf           the drawn extent, NOT the advisory `viewBox`
 *   fitTransform       that extent -> the mascot's face box
 *   applyFit           polylines in face space
 *   maskFromPolylines  a filled binary mask
 *   fieldFromMask      a signed distance field
 *   maxScaleAt         where the face goes and how big it can be
 *
 * Two things make the result honest rather than merely plausible:
 *
 * 1. Four aims. The avatar renders faces `forward`, which cancels each expression's
 *    authored gaze and hands the pointer its full travel — so the eyes can be pulled to
 *    any corner. Each body is solved against all four extreme aims at once and keeps the
 *    WORST of them. A single centred solve yields a face that clips the moment the mouse
 *    moves. Solving the aims separately and keeping the smallest answer is not enough
 *    either: each aim's best anchor is somewhere else, and a face has exactly one anchor.
 *    So the four aims' point clouds are pooled into a single constraint set, and the
 *    solver looks for one placement that satisfies all of them together.
 *
 * 2. One shared size. The smallest scale in the catalog is applied to every body, and
 *    each body's anchor is then re-solved at that fixed size. Roomier bodies get more
 *    margin rather than a bigger face, which is what makes the ten read as one character
 *    wearing different bodies instead of ten unrelated mascots.
 *
 * The run fails, loudly and with a non-zero exit, if any expression would clip at any
 * body's final anchor at any aim. That assertion is the feature's correctness guarantee:
 * if it fires, an outline or the face data is wrong. Fix the geometry, never the check.
 *
 * The output is deterministic — no clock, no environment, no unordered iteration — so a
 * fresh run reproduces the checked-in file byte for byte.
 *
 * Plain TypeScript only: this is loaded by `node --experimental-strip-types`, so nothing
 * beyond type annotations the stripper can erase.
